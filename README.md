# Verse - _evolving meta for people_

VERSE has been designed to cater to the needs of the people being the topmost priority, so that every fear of theirs ranging from identity theft to a unique one, from addiction to frequent prompts, we have incorporated every bit of their problems to create VERSE which solves them all.

## What you can do

- Press \` (tilde) key on keyboard on loading the `next-app` or demo. This will toggle the glasses and app mode.
- You can pan, zoom and drag around the map. This map is a 3d model of what we envision the metaverse to look like, but it is limitless
- Once on app screen, you can click on one of the apps, and also change the map you are on by _teleporting_ somewhere else
- You can press `q` here and that will bring up the "alert prompt" that would remind the users based on their activity when they should take a break and recommend them something to do
