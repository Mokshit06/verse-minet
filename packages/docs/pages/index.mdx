Solid Table is a collection of hooks for **building powerful tables and datagrid experiences**. These hooks are lightweight, composable, and ultra-extensible, but **do not render any markup or styles for you**. This effectively means that Solid Table is a "headless" UI library

### Designed to have zero design.

You want your tables to be powerful without sacrificing how they look! After all, what good is that nice theme you designed if you can't use it?! Solid Table is **headless** by design (it's just a hook), which means that you are in complete and full control of how your table renders down to the very last component, class or style.

And a lot [more](/docs/getting-started).
