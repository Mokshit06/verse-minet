Metaverse has been the talk of the town for a little too long now, and after a keen and in depth analysis of the meta, we’ve come to the conclusion of the cons and pros it carries with itself. While its existence still remains a question, we decided to build a product that solves the many problems that the metaverse brings in, so that whenever it comes out - it is clean and user friendly. - **VERSE** _evolving meta for people_.
VERSE has been designed to cater to the needs of the people being the topmost priority, so that every fear of theirs ranging from identity theft to a unique one, from addiction to frequent prompts, we have incorporated every bit of their problems to create VERSE which solves them all.
