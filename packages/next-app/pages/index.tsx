        <h2>Improving the experience</h2>
        <p>
          Metaverse has been the talk of the town for a little too long now, and
          after a keen and in depth analysis of the meta, weâ€™ve come to the
          conclusion of the cons and pros it carries with itself. While its
          existence still remains a question, we decided to build a product that
          solves the many problems that the metaverse brings in, so that
          whenever it comes out - it is clean and user friendly. - <i>VERSE</i>{' '}
          <b>evolving meta for people</b>. VERSE has been designed to cater to
          the needs of the people being the topmost priority, so that every fear
          of theirs ranging from identity theft to a unique one, from addiction
          to frequent prompts, we have incorporated every bit of their problems
          to create VERSE which solves them all.

              VERSE seeks to overcome the problem of addiction through frequent
              prompts that instruct the users to have a break from the virtual
              land and utilize the time in the real physical world, the prompt
              will be shown as a warning sign when the time spent on the
              platform is more than the average usage limit.

              With the usage of already existing technologies such as
              blockchain, VERSE resolves the problem of identity theft, as every
              user will have a unique identity which will never be revealed,
              every user will be able to control their data through private and
              public keys, allowing them to own it.
